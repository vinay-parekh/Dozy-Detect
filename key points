> get_frontal_face_detector(): an inbuilt function of dlib library, is a machine learning based frontal face detector, that is comparatively more accurate than haarcascade detector of ovepcv library

> a face contains 68 landmarks 

> shape_predictor(), a dlib function, is used to detect the facial landmarks

> euclidean distance formula is used to calculate the distance between two points

> an eye consists of 6 landmark points (the two points at eyebrow ends are longer distance, and the 4 other points are shorter distance)

> The numerator of this equation computes the distance between the vertical eye landmarks while the denominator computes the distance between horizontal eye landmarks, weighting the denominator appropriately since there is only one set of horizontal points but two sets of vertical points.

> 0.25 is a standard Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), which says that an eye is minimally open at this point and above  

> COLOR_BGR2GRAY is a cv2 (opencv) attribute, that is used to convert between BGR/RGB and grayscale, color conversions 

> Haarcascade is an algorithm that can detect objects in images, irrespective of their scale in image and location. This algorithm is not so complex and can run in real-time.
