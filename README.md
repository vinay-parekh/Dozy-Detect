# Dozy-Detect
This is a sleep detection module, built using python libraries and machine learning models. 

The project detects the drowsiness of the user, based on the 68 facial landmarks located on our face. The results are produced based on the effective EAR (Eye Aspect Ratio), and produces vulnerable sound alerts and vibrations on detecting drowsiness on the user's face. The module holds several potential applications, where drowsiness need to be eliminated at workplaces.
